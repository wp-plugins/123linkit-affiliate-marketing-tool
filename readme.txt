== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get started with 123LinkIt?

With a simple plug-in, 123Linkit easily integrates with blogging platforms such as WordPress. First, the plugin analyzes and extracts the most relevant keywords and ranks them in terms of relevancy to the post. Next, it matches those keywords to the appropriate affiliate links. Finally, the plugin cloaks the links and transforms the keywords into regular hyperlinks – so bloggers don’t have to worry about annoying pop-up or hover ads.

= How much does 123LinkIt cost?

Our plugins are free to use.

= Is there a minimum monthly payment?

Yes, you need to earn at least $25 in commissions to be paid. If this amount is not reached within a month, it will roll over to the next month.

= Do I use 123LinkIt before I publish my posts?

You do not need to resync your new blog posts once you initially install and synchronize your posts. We will automatically update your new posts. This is also true for edits to existing posts.

= Can I control the links that appear on my blog?

You can remove any of the links we add to your blog post. Just sign into your account on the 123LinkIt site, click on the blog you want to modify, and navigate to the blog post you would like to change. Our links will appear in red and clicking on the minus sign at the top of the link will instantly remove the ad from your post.

= Does 123LinkIt work with other contextual networks?

Absolutely. We do not violate Google Adsense’s Terms and Conditions. If you use other contextual services, please consult their respective policies.

= Do you have your own affiliate program?

Yes. Every 123LinkIt user is automatically an affiliate. All our users have the opportunity to promote our service to generate revenue. When you login to your account, you will see a Partner Central tab at the [TBD] of your dashboard. The links in this section will direct you to Partner Central where you can find your referral link, HTML code for promotional graphics, see the number of referrals you have referred, the commissions you’ve earned and when your payments have been made. Our affiliates can earn up to a 10% lifetime residual commission depending on how many bloggers they refer.

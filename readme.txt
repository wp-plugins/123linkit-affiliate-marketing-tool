What is 123LinkIt?
123LinkIt allows bloggers to streamline the affiliate marketing process by analyzing their content and transforming relevant keywords and product links into affiliate links. 

How does 123LinkIt work?
With a simple WordPress plug-in, 123Linkit easily integrates with your blog. First, the plugin analyzes and extracts the most relevant product keywords. It matches those keywords to the appropriate affiliate links and transforms them into regular hyperlinks – so bloggers don’t have to worry about annoying pop-up or hover ads.7

How does 123LinkIt make money?
It’s free to sign-up and to use our services. We only make money when the blogger makes money. Our model is performance-based and we retain fifteen percent of the commissions paid using the affiliate links our tools generate.

What if I already belong to affiliate networks?
There's no need to close your account and you can use our plug-in in conjunction with affiliate ads you already have on your site. Our affiliate plugin helps bloggers find opportunities and links they may have missed.

How will payments be processed?
Our current payment methods include Check, Debit Card and Direct Deposit. You will receive an email after you’ve accumulated $25 in your account which will require you to setup your PayQuicker account. Payments are sent on the last day of the every month via the payment method you selected.
